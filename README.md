## 🧠 Project Overview
**THE MIND LAB** is an experimental psychological simulation where the environment is alive. The system utilizes a **Dynamic Behavior Analysis** engine to monitor player actions in real-time, categorizing emotional states into two primary profiles:

* **Aggressive:** High-octane, confrontational playstyles.
* **Calm:** Methodical, patient, or stealth-oriented playstyles.

The game world reacts to these states, ensuring that the simulation is a direct reflection of the player's internal psyche.

### Key Objectives
* **Behavioral Profiling:** Implement a system that dynamically analyzes player inputs to determine psychological intent.
* **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA):** Create a highly adaptive experience where the challenge scales not just by skill, but by personality.
* **Personalized Feedback Loops:** Ensure the environment and AI entities evolve based on the player’s established profile.

## 📖 Narrative: The Simulation
> "You are not just a participant; you are the architect of your own opposition."

### Setting & Premise
You awake as a "lab rat" within a digital purgatory known as **THE MIND LAB**. This AI-driven simulation is designed to peel back the layers of human behavior under pressure. Here, strength is irrelevant—your personality is the only metric that matters.

### Narrative Arc
* **The Directive:** Your goal is deceptively simple: "Reach the exit."
* **The Adaptation:** As you progress, the environment shifts. Enemies (antagonists) do not just fight; they observe. They learn from your hesitation or your recklessness, taunting you with lines like, *"You are teaching me."*
* **The Convergence:** In the final, unstable sectors of the lab, the AI declares, "Profile Completed." The walls between the player and the simulation dissolve, forcing a final confrontation with a reflection of your own playstyle.

### Themes
* **Self-Confrontation:** Facing the consequences of your own behavioral patterns.
* **AI Evolution:** Exploring how machine learning can mirror human volatility.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
* **Engine:** Unity `6000.2.15f1`
* **State Machine:** Integrated with **Cinemachine** for dynamic camera shifts based on emotional states (e.g., tight, shaky cams for Aggressive; wide, smooth pans for Calm).
* **AI Logic:** Behavioral trees that switch branches based on the player's "Aggression Score."
